// ASSESSMENT 1: Coding Conceptual Questions

// Examine the following examples.

// First, predict the outcome based on your understanding of the code.
// Then, uncomment the console.log() and verify the output. Briefly explain why your initial answer was correct or incorrect.

// --------------------INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What will this log?
const colors = ["tangerine", "magenta", "lilac", "daffodil"]
 console.log(colors.push("indigo"))


// a) Your answer: 5
// b) Verify and explain: Output:5 This code will push "indigo" to the colors array and will log the number of elements in the array which is 5.


// --------------------1) What will this log?

const cohort = "LEARN 2022"
 console.log(cohort.length)

// a) Your answer: 10
// b) Verify and explain: This will log the length of cohort string which is 10 characters.


// --------------------2) What will this log?

const greeting = "Hello World!"
 console.log(greeting[4])


// a) Your answer: Output:o 
// b) Verify and explain: This code will log the fourth element in the array 'greeting' which would be the letter 'o'. 


// --------------------3) What will this log?

const languages = ["JavaScript", "Ruby", "Python", "C++"]
const index = 1
 console.log(languages[index])

// a) Your answer: Ruby
// b) Verify and explain: Since index is set to 1 this code block will log the first index of the the langauages array, which is "Ruby".


// --------------------4) What will this log?

const weekendDays = ["saturday", "sunday"]
//console.log(weekendDays.toUpperCase())

// a) Your answer: This should log an error because the .toUpperCase built in method applies to strings
// b) Verify and explain: The .toUpperCase built in method applies to strings so this use of it causes an error because it is an array.


// --------------------5) What will this log?

const dataTypes = ["number", "string", "Boolean"]
console.log(typeof dataTypes.length)

// a) Your answer: I beileve this will log an error.
// b) Verify and explain: The output is number I will have to ask about this in class.
