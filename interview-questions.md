# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer: A code block that is checking to see if a certain condtion is true or false in order to execute code.

  Researched answer: Conditionals will execute a code block if a condition evaluates to true or false
  

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: Git is an open source tool used to manage source code on your local machine. GitHub is a website where developers/organizations can upload source code and projects. Github integrates with git allowing users to upload and pull code that is hosted on GitHub.

  Researched answer:
  Git:Git is a tool used for version control that keeps tracking changes during the development process.
  
  GitHub: Is used to host code and projects on the cloud that you can mirror on you local machine through the use of remote repos. 
  


2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: In JS the '&&' as well as '||' (Logical AND, Logical OR return a boolean.

  Researched answer: The ||(or) and &&(and) are logical operators that return the first fully-determined “logical value” when evaluated from left to right. Also there are the !==(not equal), <= less than or equal/ => greater than or equal to. 



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: Index refers to the position of a given element in an array starting from the zero index going from left to right. Value refers to actual value at the given element. 

  Researched answer: 
  Index refers to the position of a given element in an array and the value is the actual value of said element.


4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: In a loop iteration refers to the process of iterating or looping through as long as a condtion is met. 

  Researched answer: Iteration is the looping through code while a condtion is met. 


5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: In proper pair programming there is a driver who has hands on the keyboard and a navigator. A navigator does not type during the process and is reviewing in real time.
 
  Researched answer: Pair programing is where you have 2 developers where one is coding and hands on and the other is navigating or hands off the keyboard. This allows 2 devs to work together and with proper pair programming there is a switch in roles so both can practice driving and navigating.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: A higher order function is a function that takes a function as an argument, or returns a function.

2. Jest: JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase.

3. Objects: Are objects where the values are written as name:value pairs

4. Method: JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects.

5. Classes: Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data.
